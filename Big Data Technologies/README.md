# Big Data Technologies and Why They Matter To R Users

The way we store and manage data is changing. In the old days, there were only a handful of file formats and databases. Now there are countless databases and numerous file formats. The methods by which we access the data has also increased in number. As R users, we often access and analyze data in highly inefficient ways. Big Data tech has solved some of those problems.

This presentation will take attendees on a quick tour of the various relevant Big Data technologies. I’ll explain how these technologies fit together to form a stack for various data analysis uses cases. We’ll talk about what these technologies mean for the future of analyzing data with R.

Even if you work with “small data” this presentation will still be of interest because some Big Data tech has a small data use case.
