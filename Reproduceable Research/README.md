# Reproducible Research with R, The Tidyverse, Notebooks, and Spark
Many of us data science and business analytics practitioners perform research and analysis for decision makers on a regular basis. The deliverable of such analysis often results in a Power Point presentation, and/or a model that needs to be productionalized. The code used to produce the analysis also needs to be considered a deliverable.

Many of us perform analysis without reproducibility in mind. With the increasing democratization of data, it is becoming more and more important for people that may not have scientific training to be able to create analysis that can be picked up by somebody else who can then reproduce your results. That, and creating reproducible research is just solid science.

We are going to spend an evening walking though the various tools available to create reproducible research on Big Data. You will get introduced to the Tidyverse of R packages and how to use them. We will discuss the ins and outs of various notebook technologies like Jupyter, and Zeppelin. You will have an opportunity to learn how to get up and running with R and Spark and the various options you have to learn on real clusters instead of just your local environment. There also be a quick introduction to source control and the various options you have around using Git.

The theme of the evening will be “getting started”. We will go over various training resources and show you the optimal path to go from zero to master. Some commentary will be provided around the current state of the job market and intel from the front lines of the data science language wars. This is a large topic and the evening will be fairly dynamic and responsive to the needs of the audience.
